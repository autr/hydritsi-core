In order for entries in a database to be\n * somewhat easily traceable back to the code which produced them, events sent\n * through analytics should be defined here.\n *\n * Since the AnalyticsAdapter API can be used in different ways, for some events\n * it is more convenient to just define the event name as a constant. For other\n * events a factory function is easier.\n *\n * A general approach for adding a new event:\n * 1. Determine the event type: track, UI, page, or operational. If in doubt use\n * operational.\n * 2. Determine whether the event is related to other existing events, and\n * which fields are desired to be set: name, action, actionSubject, source.\n * 3. If the name is sufficient (the other fields are not important), use a\n * constant. Otherwise use a factory function.\n *\n * Note that the AnalyticsAdapter uses the events passed to its functions for\n * its own purposes, and might modify them. Because of this, factory functions\n * should create new objects.\n *\n */\n\n/**\n * The constant which identifies an event of type \"operational\".\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const TYPE_OPERATIONAL = 'operational';\n\n/**\n * The constant which identifies an event of type \"page\".\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const TYPE_PAGE = 'page';\n\n/**\n * The constant which identifies an event of type \"track\".\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const TYPE_TRACK = 'track';\n\n/**\n * The constant which identifies an event of type \"ui\".\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const TYPE_UI = 'ui';\n\n/**\n * The \"action\" value for Jingle events which indicates that the Jingle session\n * was restarted (TODO: verify/fix the documentation)\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const ACTION_JINGLE_RESTART = 'restart';\n\n/**\n * The \"action\" value for Jingle events which indicates that a session-accept\n * timed out (TODO: verify/fix the documentation)\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const ACTION_JINGLE_SA_TIMEOUT = 'session-accept.timeout';\n\n/**\n * The \"action\" value for Jingle events which indicates that a session-initiate\n * was received.\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const ACTION_JINGLE_SI_RECEIVED = 'session-initiate.received';\n\n/**\n * The \"action\" value for Jingle events which indicates that a session-initiate\n * not arrived within a timeout (the value is specified in\n * the {@link JingleSessionPC}.\n * @type {string}\n */\nexport const ACTION_JINGLE_SI_TIMEOUT = 'session-initiate.timeout';\n\n/**\n * A constant for the \"terminate\" action for Jingle events.

Class implements <tt>LoggerTransport</tt>\n * and thus can be added as global transport in order to capture all the logs.\n *\n * It captures subsequent log lines created whenever <tt>Logger</tt> logs\n * a message and stores them in a queue in order to batch log entries. There are\n * time and size limit constraints which determine how often batch entries are\n * stored. Whenever one of these limits is exceeded the <tt>LogCollector</tt>\n * will use the <tt>logStorage</tt> object given as an argument to save\n * the batch log entry.\n *\n * @param {Object} logStorage an object which allows to store the logs collected\n * @param {function(string|object[])} logStorage.storeLogs a method called when\n * this <tt>LogCollector</tt> requests log entry storage. The method's argument\n * is an array which can contain <tt>string</tt>s and <tt>object</tt>s. If given\n * item is an object it means that it's an aggregated message. That is a message\n * which is the same as the previous one and it's representation has\n * the following format:\n * {\n *   {string} text: 'the text of some duplicated message'\n *   {number} count: 3 // how many times the message appeared in a row\n * }\n * If a message \"B\" after an aggregated message \"A\" is different, then it breaks\n * the sequence of \"A\". Which means that even if the next message \"C\" is\n * the same as \"A\" it will start a new aggregated message \"C\".\n * @param {function()} logStorage.isReady a method which should return\n * a <tt>boolean</tt> to tell the collector that it's ready to store. During the\n * time storage is not ready log batches will be cached and stored on the next\n * occasion (flush or interval timeout).\n *\n * @param {Object} options the <tt>LogCollector</tt> configuration options.\n * @param {number} options.maxEntryLength the size limit for a single log entry\n * to be stored. The <tt>LogCollector</tt> will push the entry as soon as it\n * reaches or exceeds this limit given that <tt>logStorage.isReady</tt>\n * returns <tt>true</tt>.
